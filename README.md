# sudoku solver (noob projects!) 
Solves sudoku with backtracking algorithm. 
Just wanted to play around with backtracking and python, this is a terrible solver and terrible code. 

## todo 
- implement an actual board generator 
- implement other solving algorithms (maybe stochastic algo)? 
- fix up backtracking algorithm, probably has some unnecessary steps 
- eventually implement a good soduku library
